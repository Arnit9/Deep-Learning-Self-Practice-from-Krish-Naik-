In data we have T =Average Temperature (°C) ,TM = Maximum temperature (°C) ,Tm == Minimum temperature (°C) , SLP = Atmospheric pressure at sea level (hPa) , H = Average relative humidity (%) ,VV = Average visibility (Km) ,V = Average wind speed (Km/h) ,VM =Maximum sustained wind speed (Km/h).

We also need PM 2.5 value, PM 2.5 values are collected
